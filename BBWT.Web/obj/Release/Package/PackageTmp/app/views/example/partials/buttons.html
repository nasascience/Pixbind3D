<h3>Buttons</h3>

<p>
    Within a form page, buttons should align with the left edge of the text.<br />
    Within a pop-up dialog that that has labelled controls, buttons should align with the controls.<br />
    Within a pop-up dialog that contains no labelled controls, buttons should align centrally.
</p>
<div class="form-horizontal">
    <button class="k-button">Button</button>
</div>
<pre>
&lt;button class="k-button"&gt;Button&lt;/button>
</pre>
<p>
    Use “Save” as a button title on Edit pages, not “OK”.<br />
    Use “Save” as a button title on popups that immediately commit data to the database, not “OK”.<br />
    On tabs, place the Save button outside the tab control, and when Save is hit, validate all the tab pages and then save all the changes on the tab pages.
